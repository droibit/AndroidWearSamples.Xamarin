{"Name":"Android Wear Developer Preview","Id":624,"Alias":"androidwearpreview","Description":"The Android Wear Developer Preview provides tools and APIs that allow you to enhance your app notifications, giving an optimized user experience on Android Wear.\n\nWith the Android Wear Developer Preview, you can:\n\n - Run the Android Wear platform in the Android emulator.\n - Connect your Android device to the emulator and view notifications from the device as cards on Android Wear.\n - Try new APIs in the preview support library that enhance your app\u0027s notifications with features such as voice replies and notification pages.\n \nAndroid Wear builds on the notification subsystem introduced in Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) and its Android Support v4 counterpart (NotificationCompat API). It will thus integrate out of the box with your existing app notifications.\n\nThis component allows your Xamarin.Android application to use the extra notification features introduced by Wear such as paged navigation, voice control input or notification stacking. Simply wrap your existing `NotificationCompat.Builder` instances using the new `WearableNotifications.Builder` class to start using the API subset.\n\nYou can read the following [Android developer article][5] to learn how the existing notification API translates into the Android Wear world.\n\nThe Android Wear Developer Preview component is a Xamarin binding project for the [Android Wear][4] Sender SDK.\n  \n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCaution\u003c/strong\u003e: The current Android Wear Developer Preview is intended for \u003cstrong\u003edevelopment and testing purposes only\u003c/strong\u003e, not for production apps. Google may change this Developer Preview significantly prior to the official release of the Android Wear SDK. You may not publicly distribute or ship any application using this Developer Preview, as this Developer Preview will no longer be supported after the official SDK is released (which will cause applications based only on the Developer Preview to break).\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n*Portions of this page are modifications based on [work][3] created and [shared by the Android Open Source Project][1] and used according to terms described in the [Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution License][2].*\n\n[1]: http://code.google.com/policies.html\n[2]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/\n[3]: http://developer.android.com/wear/preview/start.html\n[4]: http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html\n[5]: http://developer.android.com/wear/notifications/creating.html\n\n","Version":"1.0.0.1","Summary":"Extends the Android platform to a new generation of wearable devices.","QuickStart":"###Prerequisites###\n\nYou must [sign up][4] with a Gmail or other Google account in order to download the preview support library and receive access to the Android Wear Preview app on Google Play Store.\n\nFor instructions on installing the _Android Wear system image_ and setting up the _Android Wear Emulator_ and the _Android Wear Preview App_, see the [Get Started][5] page for Android Wear.\n\n###Showing a two page notification###\n\t\n\nCreating a default notification as the first page:\n\n``` csharp\nvar builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder (this)\n\t.SetSmallIcon (Resource.Drawable.ic_logo)\n\t.SetLargeIcon (largeIcon)\n\t.SetContentText (\"Short Service announcement\")\n\t.SetContentTitle (\"Page 1\")\n\t.SetContentIntent (pendingIntent);\n```\n\nUsing BigText style for the second notification page:\n\n``` csharp\nvar secondPageStyle = new NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle();\nsecondPageStyle.BigText(\"Xamarin.Android goes on your Android Wear too\");\n\nvar secondNotification = new NotificationCompat.Builder (this)\n\t.SetSmallIcon (Resource.Drawable.ic_logo)\n\t.SetLargeIcon (largeIcon)\n\t.SetContentTitle (\"Page 2\")\n\t.SetStyle (secondPageStyle)\n\t.Build ();\n```\n\nBridging the two pages together using some of the new API introduced with Android Wear:\n\n``` csharp\nvar twoPageNotification = new WearableNotifications.Builder(builder)\n\t.AddPage(secondNotification)\n\t.Build();\n\nNotificationManagerCompat.From (this)\n\t.Notify (\"multi-page-notification\", 1000, twoPageNotification);\n```\n\n[4]: http://developer.android.com/wear/preview/signup.html\n[5]: http://developer.android.com/wear/preview/start.html\n\n","Hash":"fec26706d0b6573f1cc1920eeb0a28cb","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
